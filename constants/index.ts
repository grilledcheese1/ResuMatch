Here is the resume section relevant to this tip:

Your task: Rewrite ONLY the specific passage or section of the resume that this improvement tip refers to.
- Output only the rewritten passage — no headings, no explanations, no preamble, no markdown.
- Preserve the candidate's voice and first-person style.
- Strengthen impact verbs, quantify where reasonable, and align with the job description keywords.
- Keep the output concise — match the approximate length of the original passage.
- Do not rewrite the entire resume. Target only what the tip addresses.`;
